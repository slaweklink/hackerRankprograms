Hi guys, I really need your support as I'd like to continue my uploads. Thanks to all of you who have supported me so far. For more sustainable support, I'd greatly appreciate it if you can become a member via the link above. You can join for as little as $2 per month and it goes a long way. It really helps in bringing you the latest and being consistent with my uploads.

When you become a member you will get a request form link to request books and audiobooks. I'll do my best to find them for you and upload them to my accounts.

1st membership goal: 2 / 550 members

When first membership goal is reached, I will start uploading audiobooks too.

Thank you very much guys.
